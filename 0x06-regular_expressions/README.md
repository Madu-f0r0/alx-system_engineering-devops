# 0x06. Regular expression #

This project explores the use of regular expressions (regex) in Devops. For this project, regex is implemented on Ruby programming language using Oniguruma regular expression library (the default regex library for Ruby). The expressions were tested on [Rubular](https://rubular.com/)(a Ruby regular expression editor).
