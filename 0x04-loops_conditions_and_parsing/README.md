### 0x04. Loops, conditions and parsing ###

This project is a continuation of the bash scripting course in the ALX SE program. This project highlights the following concepts:

## Concepts ##
- Loops: `for`, `while`, and `until` loops
- Conditions: the `if`, `elif` and `else` condiional statements
- Parsing a given input using commands such as `cut`, `grep`, `sed`, and parameter expansion
- Increasing the portability of a bash script through the shebang `#!/usr/env bash`
- Using the program `shellcheck` to check for syntax and semantics errors in bash scripts
