# 0x05. Processes and signals #
This project is in fulfillment of the ALX SE program and focuses on process management and signal handling in linux using bash scripts.

## Key Concepts ##
- Retrieving the PID of a running process of a program using `echo $$`
- Displaying processes in different formats using `ps` and `pgrep`
- Sending a terminating signal to a process using `kill` and `pkill`
- Handling a signal in a program using `trap`
