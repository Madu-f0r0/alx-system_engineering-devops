# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters project #
This project is an introduction to the Linux concept of input/output redirections across files using different Linux commands. The commands introduced or used in more depth in this project are: 
- `echo`
- `cat`
- `head`
- `tail`
- `find`
- `wc`
- `sort`
- `uniq`
- `grep`
- `tr`
- `rev`
- `cut`

I used the above commands to write bash scripts to perform the functions as described below.

## Advanced Scripts ##

- [100-empty_casks](https://github.com/Madu-f0r0/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x02-shell_redirections/100-empty_casks) finds all empty files and directories in the current directory and all sub-directories.
	* Only the names of the files and directories should be displayed (not the entire path)
	* Hidden files should be listed
	* One file name per line
	* The listing should end with a new line
	* `basename`, `grep`, `egrep`, `fgrep` or `rgrep` are not allowed for this task

- [101-gifs](https://github.com/Madu-f0r0/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x02-shell_redirections/101-gifs) lists all the files with a `.gif` extension in the current directory and all its sub-directories.
	* Hidden files should be listed
	* Only regular files (not directories) should be listed
	* The names of the files should be displayed without their extensions
	* The files should be sorted by byte values, but case-insensitive
	* One file name per line
